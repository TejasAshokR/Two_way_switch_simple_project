# Two_way_switch_simple_project
A two way switch can be explained using a simple example. Consider a room with two switches and one bulb. Now, If both the switches are in OFF state or ON state the bulb will not glow. But, if either of the two switch is ON the bulb will glow. If we have to relate this with digital electronics, the logic can be realised using an X-OR gate.
